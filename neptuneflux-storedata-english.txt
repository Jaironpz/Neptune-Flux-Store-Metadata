Neptune Flux is a story-driven, open world adventure game set in a sci-fi ocean full of mystery and haunting beauty. The world above the water is a dust bowl and an escape into space is out of reach. Humanity's last hope of survival is the untouched ecosystem of the deep sea, and A.Q.U.A. is the worldwide market leader in underwater colonization. In Neptune Flux, you take on the role of Sarah, an A.Q.U.A. employee tasked with finding the source of strange energy surges that are disrupting A.Q.U.A. operations. As you carry out A.Q.U.A. missions and explore the sea floor, you’ll discover the dark secrets that lurk below.

- FIND LOST TREASURE Earn cash by completing missions for A.Q.U.A., finding lost shipwrecks, and recovering valuable cargo.
- PLAY ON PS VR Look around the humble interior of Sarah's dive pod and see the stunning scale of huge wreck sites on the sea floor.
